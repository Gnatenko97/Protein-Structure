Examining Secondary Structure of Proteins

Proteins are complex macrochemical structures

![GitHub Logo](/test.jpg)

Background
1. Made of chain of amino acids there are four levels of strucutres
2. Depending on binding properties and polarity of each amino acid different secoundary structures are formed
3. Coilical, Beta-Sheets and Alpha-Helical




having a large database of Proteins with anotated secondary structure we can do alittle statistics

anotations stend for 
C-coilical structure
H-alpha helical structure 
E-beta sheets 

For example protein 116 in the database has following characteristics

 - Protein under examination: 1FS9A
 - Sequence of first 20 AA:   MTKFKLLLAGSLVAIVSMGLLASNINEREKERVALNKTAH...
 - Anotation of first 20 AA:  CCCCEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHCCCCHHHCCCCHHCCCHH...

Database says protein has mostly Alph-Helix structures
